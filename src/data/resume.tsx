  summary:
    "My focus area for the past few years has been front-end development with React and Next.Js, utilizing TypeScript. I am also skilled in back-end development with Node.js using tRPC and have experience using TypeScript in that context as well. In the past, [I pursued a degree in information technology](/#education), [interned at some open source communities and developed my skills](https://teksade.vercel.app/), and [competed in over 5 hackathons for fun](/#hackathons). I also had the pleasure of being a part of the in-person cohort of web3Bridge at [Nigeria](https://www.web3bridgeafrica.com/).",
